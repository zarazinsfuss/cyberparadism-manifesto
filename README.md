This is a web manifesto of the Cyberparadism aesthetic. Cyberparadism originated on the [Aesthetics Wiki](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Cyberparadism) where it got formalized for the first time and is an aesthetic that celebrates the positive potential of technology and scientific progress to create a better future for humanity. At its core, Cyberparadism is about using technology to enhance the human experience, promote sustainability, and foster a sense of collective purpose and responsibility.

This is not a political or economical manifesto. It serves the purpose to declare the aesthetical principles of Cyberparadism and its derivates. Other names for Cyberparadism are Cyber Paradise, Cybergenesis, Neogenesis. An aesthetic works very similarly like an idea. It seeks to inspire and stimulate imagination rather than provide a comprehensive plan for societal change. Cyberparadism offers a compelling vision of a future where technology and nature coexist in harmony, where abundance and prosperity are available to all, and where the human experience is enhanced by the responsible use of technology.

As an aesthetic, Cyberparadism offers a framework for exploring the potential of technology to create a better world, and encourages creativity and innovation in the pursuit of a higher purpose. Whether referred to as Cyber Paradise, Cybergenesis, or Neogenesis, Cyberparadism is a vision of a brighter future, where the beauty and power of nature are celebrated, and where technology is used to enhance rather than detract from the natural world.

We believe that technology can be a powerful force for good, when used in a responsible and thoughtful way. By harnessing the power of technology, we can create a world of abundance and prosperity, where all individuals have the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential.

At the heart of Cyberparadism is a commitment to preservation and embetterment of life through the keen pursuit of science and the positive use of technology. We recognize that our current economic and social order needs to adapt, and that we must embrace new approaches to democratize a pristine way of life. 

We believe that the future of technology lies not in the pursuit of profit or power, but in the pursuit of a higher purpose. Through the responsible use of technology, we can create a world where abundance and prosperity are available to all, where we live in harmony with nature, and where we work together to achieve shared goals.

As Cyberparadists, we are committed to promoting the values of ingenuity, continuity, and siblinghood. We recognize that technology alone is not enough to create a better world, and that we must collaborate which each other to build a more just and equitable society.

We believe that the future is not predetermined, but is shaped by our choices and actions. By embracing the principles of Cyberparadism, we can create a world of abundance and prosperity, where all individuals are empowered to reach their full potential and contribute to the greater good.

Join us in imagining a better future, and in working towards a world where technology is used to enhance the human experience and promote sustainability. Together, we can create a Cyberparadise – a world where technology and nature coexist in harmony, and where abundance and prosperity are available to all.

## The Laws of Cyberparadism

> "We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive."

> — Albert Einstein

In the realm of Cyberparadism, we uphold a set of guiding principles that embody our vision for a harmonious future, where technology and nature coexist and enrich each other. These principles, or Laws, serve as the foundation of our aesthetic and our ethos, shaping our understanding of how technology can be harnessed to create a prosperous, equitable, and sustainable world. They are the pillars upon which Cyberparadism stands, guiding our endeavors and inspiring our imaginations as we work towards our vision of an idyllic future.

1. **The Law of Abundance**: Cyberparadism is founded on the belief that technology can be a powerful catalyst for abundance and prosperity. We strive to employ technology in ways that enhance human experiences, and promote social and economic equality, envisioning a future where scarcity is replaced by abundance for all.

2. **The Law of Equity**: In Cyberparadism, we uphold the principle of equity. We assert that the benefits of technology should be accessible to all, ensuring basic necessities and the advantages of progress are equitably distributed. While we value recognition and reward for individual achievements, we insist that everyone's fundamental needs are satisfied, guaranteeing a baseline standard of living and well-being.

3. **The Law of Freedom**: Cyberparadism fervently advocates for freedom of thought, creativity, and self-expression. We envision a future where technology empowers individuals, fosters diversity of thought, and promotes the free exchange of ideas. We are committed to safeguarding privacy and personal autonomy in this technologically interconnected world.

4. **The Law of Harmony**: At the heart of Cyberparadism is the aspiration to achieve harmony between technology and nature. We strive for a world where these two forces coexist peacefully and complement each other, rather than being in conflict, promoting a future where tech-enhanced life is integrated seamlessly with the natural world.

5. **The Law of Preservation**: Cyberparadism upholds the importance of environmental preservation and biodiversity. We encourage technological innovations that respect and preserve the planet's diverse ecosystems, promoting a delicate balance between technological advancement and conservation, ensuring a sustainable future for all life.

6. **The Law of Recognition**: Cyberparadism promotes the principle of recognizing and rewarding individual achievements and contributions. We believe in an inclusive future where opportunities facilitated by technology are open to all, and the fruits of these efforts are shared based on the merit of each contribution, fostering an environment of fairness and continuous growth.

7. **The Law of Responsibility**: Cyberparadism emphasizes the profound responsibility that comes with great technological power. We insist on responsible and thoughtful use of technology, with deep respect for the natural world and the needs of communities. We champion conscientious technological development that is mindful of its impacts on the environment and society.

8. **The Law of Simplicity**: Simplicity and minimalism are core values in Cyberparadism. We seek to design and create technologies that are easy to use and understand, embracing the principle that technology should simplify life, not complicate it. We strive for solutions that are elegant in their simplicity, yet powerful in their impact.

These Laws of Cyberparadism represent the guiding lights of the aesthetic of the potentiality of a harmonious coexistence of technology and nature. They are not hierarchical in nature, but rather complementary facets of a whole, each shedding light on a different aspect of our shared vision. We believe that these laws should be interpreted and applied in a manner that respects their interconnectedness and mutual dependence. It is not about prioritizing one over another, but understanding how they all weave together to create the fabric of Cyberparadism. The balance and harmony among these Laws is key to achieving the ideal we strive for, a future where technology enhances human experience, fosters equity, and preserves the beauty of our natural world.

## The Signs of Cyberparadism

> "Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, "By doing this, the machine will run fast. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves."
